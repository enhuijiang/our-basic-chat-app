# our-basic-chat-app

Build a web site by using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf.

developing a rudimentary chat application, where users can submit messages along with their username,
and those messages (along with the usernames of the users who sent them) will be visible to any user that navigates to the /chat URL. 
Additionally, users should be able to select a message "mode": either Say, Shout, or Whisper. 
Say should display the message as written, 
while Shout should display the message in all-uppercase, 
and Whisper should display the message in all-lowercase.
